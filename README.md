This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift related to the use of the reduce function. The issue occurs when the '+' operator is used directly without explicitly specifying its behavior within the closure. The bug.swift file contains the erroneous code, resulting in unexpected behavior.  The bugSolution.swift file provides the correct implementation, ensuring proper handling of each array element.
